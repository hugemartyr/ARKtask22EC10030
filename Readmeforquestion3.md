**Hii Intro to my thought process on implementation of question 1**
(can ignore the bracket remarks they are my perceptions during the thought process)

The question, as far to my understanding of it ,requires me to form a 2x2 filter by peformin the following operation on each bits value, That is multiplying it by 10*pi and rounding it off to the greatest integer less than or equal to it. So the distorted image is the pi_image.png is a result of this filter being applied on the original image. And the original image link is corrupted and I got 'Rick-rolled' (hahaha song's too good ngl)
The hint for the Picasso thing is that thru my network of spies i found out that Picasso might be a cheater or not, and as he only knows 3 operations, Bit-wise OR,Bit-wise AND, Bit-wise XOR, the third one being a combination of AND, OR and NOT gate, so i am guessing this the filter he's using to distort the portarait is the same filter Grant Sanderson used to distort Mr Kcir's artpeice. SO As I can't apply the filter due to lack of my coding skills and lacking of basics thereof, I am guessing the portrait may or may not be the Picasso's original. (but in my opinion Picasso was an exceptional arists in his own sense of developing landmarks techniques as cubism,and perspective definitions , he may not be guilty and hi eccentric self might have distorted one of his own paintings)
I might have largely misunderstood the third part
